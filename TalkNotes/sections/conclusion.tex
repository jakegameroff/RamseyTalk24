\section{Final Remarks}
Ramsey Theory is a fundamental branch of combinatorics. Not only are Ramsey-theoretic problems exciting on their own, but they also have some really nice applications to other branches of math such as analysis. In particular, the classical infinite Ramsey theorem offers an especially elegant proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem.
